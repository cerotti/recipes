<h1>Cacio e pepe (or just cum)</h1>
<p>This is a very yummy pasta, it's almost a carbonara but a bit lighter and it looks like it's made with cum (it's not)</p>

<p>Difficulty:<b>medium</b> <br>Time:<b>30-40min</b> <br>Kcal:<b>bro it's not for a diet I'm sorry</b> <br>Servings: <b>4 people</b> </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>400g</b> Spagott pasta</li>
    <li>black pepper</li>
    <li><b>200g</b> pecorino cheese <em>(no you stupid dumb fuck you cannot use another type of cheese coz it's not cacio e pepe then)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put on the fire a pot with water to cook the pasta: fill it with about half of the water you usually use, this way it will be richer in starch. In the meantime, grate the pecorino</li>
    <li>Transfer the pecorino in a bowl, keeping some aside for serving.</li>
    <li>When the water has come to a boil, salt moderately and dip the spaghetti</li>
    <li>Grind the pepper if it's not already and put it in a non stick pan and toast it on low heat. Pour just a bit of the boiling water</li>
    <li>Take off the spaghetti 2-3mins before the time showed on the package and put them in the pan but keep some of the water</li>
    <li>Finish cooking them in the pan while stirring</li>
    <li>Now prepare the pecorino cream. Finely grate the pecorino in a bowl and then add a bit of the boiling water you used for the pasta. Whip vigorously</li>
    <li>Pour the cream in the pan when it's creamy but a bit pasty</li>
    <li>With low heat, adjust with more pecorino or more water for respectively more pastiness or more creaminess</li>
    <li>Serve with the remaining pecorino on top. You can add more pepper if you wish. If you have truffles, add a bit on top for extra wealth</li>
</ol>
